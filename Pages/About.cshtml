        The Student Generator is a tool designed to produce a hypothetical student (or students) based on the demographic data of a specific school. Teachers and students can use the student generator to build an idea about the type of students that attend their school with them.

        No. Any similarity of generated students to actual persons is purely coincidental. 
        However the demographic data used to generate the students is based on real data from various sources including 
        the U.S. Census Bureau, CDC, and independent researchers. Data sources used can be found in the citations below.
        The power of the student generator is in knowing that even though the specific generated student is not real, 
        there are real students at your school that are similar to the generated student.

        Often it is difficult to imagine others complexly. The Student Generator can be used to help students and teachers recognize unique aspects of the people of their school.
        For instance, a teacher may use the generator to get an idea of how many students in their class may struggle with having friends at school.
        A student may use the generator to help them develop a story about a student who is different from them as part of an empathy exercise.
